#' Compute Approximate Effective Number of Clusters for Regression Coefficients
#'
#' Specifically, for each coefficient the function returns the quantity
#' \eqn{G^{*A}}, the feasible version of \eqn{G^*}, introduced by
#' Carter, Schnepel, and Steigerwald (2017).  \eqn{G^{*A}} does not
#' accommodate multi-way clustering.
#'
#' @param object a formula or an object of class "lm", "plm", 
#' "fixest" (with method "feols"), or (for the default method)
#' a matrix of regressors
#' @param cluster cluster identifier:
#' a variable, a formula (see details), or, a length one
#' character vector naming a variable in \code{data}.
#' @param data a dataframe (see details)
#' @param subset an optional vector used to select cases from \code{data}
#' @param exclude a vector of regular expressions for variables to be excluded
#' from the return
#' @param include.only a vector of regular expressions for variables to be
#' included in the return (implying others excluded)
#' @param fixed logical indicates how regular expressions in \code{exclude}
#' or \code{include.only} should be evaluated (as in \code{grep})
#' @param nominal logical indicating whether the number of clusters should
#' be included as the first element of the return vector
#' @param rho numeric scalar that changes assumed variance matrix (see details)
#' @param XpXinv the \eqn{k \times k} matrix \eqn{(X'X)^{-1}} where
#' \eqn{X} is \eqn{n\times k} matrix \code{object} for the default method
#' @param tags a character vector containing a subset of the column names of
#' \code{object}
#' @param ... arguments passed to methods
#' @return vector of effective number of clusters for coefficients. 
#' @details
#' When \code{object} is a formula, it does not need a response variable
#' (left-hand side), but if the response variable might have different
#' missing cases than the right-hand side, it should be included. Cluster
#' fixed effects, if any, must be explicitly included in
#' the formula, or \code{data} should be appropriately transformed data. When
#' there are only one or two fixed effects, the \pkg{data.table} package is
#' especially handy for coding the transformation; see the example.  For
#' fixed effects on more than two dimensions, \code{fixest::demean} can
#' be used (or just provide the result of \code{fixest::feols}.)
#'
#' For regression objects, when \code{cluster} is a formula or a one
#' element character vector, it is evaluated in the context of the data
#' used for the model, and the \code{data} and \code{subset} arguments
#' are ignored with a warning.
#'
#' The \code{data} argument is required when \code{object} is a formula.
#' In this case, \code{object} is evaluated in the context of \code{data}.
#' If \code{cluster} is a formula or length 1 character vector, it is
#' interpreted as the name of a column of \code{data}.
#'
#' If \code{cluster} is a variable, it must not contain \code{NA} and its
#' length must equal \code{nobs(reg)} or the number of rows in (subsetted)
#' data when \code{object} is a formula.
#'
#' By default \eqn{G^{*A}} is returned for all coefficients.
#' The output may be limited by using \code{include.only}
#' or \code{exclude}. This does not affect the computation
#' for coefficients that are included, only the vector returned.
#'
#' The regular expressions used by \code{include.only} or \code{exclude}
#' should refer to the contents of \code{names(coef(reg))}, which might differ
#' from how the regression formula refers to the same things.
#' For example, groups of variables entered by using something
#' like \code{factor(statefip)} in the regression formula show up in the
#' coefficient vector names looking like \code{factor(statefip)27}.
#' They can be excluded en mass by the regular expression
#' \code{exclude="^factor\\(statefip\\)"} (parentheses need to be
#' escaped in a regular expression). Alternatively, you can
#' specify \code{fixed=TRUE}, which has the same meaning as for \code{grep}.
#'
#' Carter et al. recommend assuming every element of the variance matrix of
#' errors in a cluster is 1, a conservative scenario. However, as explained
#' in "A Note on Computation," the default \code{rho} is 0.999, so that the
#' variance matrix has 1 on the diagonal and 0.999 off the diagonal.  It is
#' possible to set \code{rho=1}, but that produces incorrect values in
#' when there are cluster fixed effects. In other cases the
#' computation is not very sensitive to the value of \code{rho}, so there
#' is no appreciable difference between \code{rho=1} and \code{rho=0.999}.
#' MacKinnon, Nielsen, and Webb (2022) argue that cluster fixed effects
#' usually remove much of the intra-cluster correlation, justifying \code{rho}
#' close to zero. (However, this is inconsistent with the ``worst case
#' scenario'' approach that motivates Carter et al.'s recommendation.)
#'
#' \code{effClust} will return a value for a \code{glm} object (or a formula
#' intended for a GLM). The result might or might not be a useful diagnostic.
#' On one hand, \eqn{G^*} is fundamentally about the characteristics of
#' the clusters. On the other hand, the derivation by Carter et. al.
#' is based on linear regression.
#'
#' \strong{Default method.}
#' The default method is a bare-bones function that does the actual
#' calculation of the effective number of clusters; it is mainly intended to
#' be a tool for adding methods.  It provides none of the error checking that
#' is normally performed by the \code{effClust} methods.
#'
#' The matrix \code{object} must have column names.  It also must 
#' include a column of ones if the hypothetical regression includes 
#' an intercept.
#'
#' If \code{XpXinv} is provided, it will
#' be indexed using \code{tags}, so its row and column names must be
#' identical to (or a superset of) \code{tags}.
#'
#' If \code{object} cannot be coerced to numeric, the function will fail.
#' Logical columns of \code{object} will be coerced to numeric, but factors
#' will \emph{not} be expanded to dummy variables as done by \code{model.matrix}.
